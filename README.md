# Eduku
Essentially, Eduku will be a self-funded, transparent and community guided charity (social enterprise) that uses 100% of profit from the sale of school services and supplies to realise its vision. By simply purchasing products and services that one will use anyway, schools, teachers and parents can not only support but actually be part of an organization that has the potential to change millions of lives.
